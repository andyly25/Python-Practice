Two weeks ago I started relearning Python to pick up on the 
basics and relearn coding skills that I may have forgotten.
Python is pretty simple to pick up and I'm wondering if I 
should stick with Python.

I should work hard on Python and yada yada.
I should definitely improve my typing speed.
It's pretty inferior compared to others in my field.

I more or less use the four fingers of my Left hadn and 
use the three middle fingers of my right hand.
Definitely awkward when I have to use numbers and other
special characters
