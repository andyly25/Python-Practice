# Intro:
- This directory will be for explore data visualization through Python.
- Data Visualization: exploring data through visual representations
    - Data mining: using code to explore patterns and connections in a data set.
        - data set: can be a small list of numbers up to gigabytes of data.
- More than just pretty pictures
    - Helps see patterns and significance in data sets.
- We'll be analyzing data online in two common formats: CSV and JSON
    - CSV: comma separated values, tricky for humans to read, but easy to process and extract data from 
- **Note: for all who reads this README, for things like Install matplotlib, please refer to Google-senpai for assistance.**

## Installations to start:
- Install matplotlib first.
    - a mathematical plotting library.
    - matplotlib gallery at: http://matplotlib.org/
- Install Pygal next
    - Python visualization package which produces scalable vector graphic files.
    - helps scale to fit users screens
    - mac/linux: pip install --user pygal
    - pygal gallery at: http://www.pygal.org/
